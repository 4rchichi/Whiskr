                    <p>A balanced diet is essential for your cat's health. High-quality protein should be the
                        foundation, with appropriate portions based on age, weight, and activity level. Fresh water
                        must always be available. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require nutrients found
                        only in animal products. Choose foods with real meat as the first ingredient and avoid fillers
                        like corn or wheat. Proper nutrition supports healthy skin, shiny coat, strong muscles, and
                        optimal energy levels throughout your cat's life.</p>

                    <p>Avoid feeding cats human food, especially chocolate, onions, garlic, and grapes. Consult your
                        veterinarian for specific dietary recommendations tailored to your cat's needs. Many human
                        foods are toxic to cats and can cause serious health problems or even death. Other dangerous
                        foods include raw eggs, raw fish, dairy products, and anything containing xylitol. Always
                        monitor your cat's weight and adjust portions accordingly, as obesity is a common problem that
                        leads to diabetes, arthritis, and shortened lifespan.</p>

                    <p>Good dental hygiene is crucial for a cat's overall health, as dental disease can lead to
                        serious kidney, liver, and heart problems. The simple act of feeding dry kibble is rarely
                        enough to keep teeth clean. Regular brushing with cat-specific toothpaste, dental treats, and
                        professional cleanings are essential for preventing periodontal disease. Studies show that by
                        age three, most cats show signs of dental disease.</p>

                    <p>Litter should be scooped once or twice daily. The entire box should be emptied and scrubbed
                        with mild soap and water (avoid harsh chemical cleaners, as the smell can deter cats) every
                        one to four weeks. Cats are extremely clean animals and may refuse to use a dirty litter box,
                        leading to inappropriate elimination behavior. Provide one litter box per cat plus one extra,
                        and place them in quiet, accessible locations.</p>

                    <p>Regular veterinary check-ups are essential for maintaining your cat's health. Annual
                        examinations help detect issues early, and keeping vaccinations up to date protects against
                        common diseases. During wellness visits, your vet will check your cat's weight, teeth, heart,
                        lungs, and overall condition. Senior cats (over seven years) should visit the vet twice yearly
                        as they're more prone to kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes.</p>

                    <p>Mental and physical enrichment is vital for a cat's wellbeing. Provide climbing structures,
                        interactive toys, scratching posts, and dedicated playtime to keep your cat happy and healthy.
                        Cats are natural hunters and need outlets for their instincts through puzzle feeders, feather
                        wands, and rotating toy selection to prevent boredom. Window perches offer entertainment
                        through bird-watching, while vertical spaces like cat trees satisfy climbing instincts.</p>
